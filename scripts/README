To use this scripts, you have to add the projects location to the
pythonpath. This is easily archieved by setting an environment variable
like this:

export PYTHONPATH=/opt/projects/:/opt/projects/dns_mdb

It is important that both the path abov the project and the project
folder itself are added to the path before the script is run.
